Notes:
* Assignment Page: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/4290/assignments/33152
* Repo Page: https://github.com/oatmealandcoffee/zombietranslator
* Jasmine Tests need to be run with Karma on RequireJS modules.

Bugs:
* translation ~95% accurate
    * 'ro' -> 'u'
    * 'ore' -> 'oer'
    * 're' -> 'er'

Roadmap:
X Migrate stacks into modules
X Update translation object into IIFE
    / Did not work; tx could not be defined

> Implement Jasmine
> Migrate to framework provided
    X Move files to new 'app' folder
    X Test move
    X Create 'tests' folder
    X Move spec to tests
    X add spec to require
> Create tests
    X Create test for Zombify
    X Create test for Unzombify
    * Create 3 different jasmine "expect" methods per rule.
        * http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html
        * Values
            * boolean
            * int
            * object {a:1, b:2} = {a:1, b:2}
        * Matchers
                            boo int str rgx obj var arr err
expect.toBe             :   *   *   *
expect.toMatch          :               *
expect.toBeDefined      :                   *   *
expect.toBeUndefined    :                   *   *
expect.toBeNull         :                       *
expect.toContain        :                           *
expect.toBeLessThan     :       *
expect.toBeGreaterThan  :       *
expect.toThrow          :                               *
