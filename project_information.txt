Additional Copyright: None
Source:	New source only; no adaptations.
Requirements: None
Notes:
* Assignment Page: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/4290/assignments/33152
* Repo Page: https://github.com/oatmealandcoffee/zombietranslator
* Jasmine Tests need to be run with Karma on RequireJS modules.

Bugs:
* translation ~95% accurate
    * 'ro' -> 'u'
    * 'ore' -> 'oer'
    * 're' -> 'er'

Roadmap:
X Migrate stacks into modules
X Update translation object into IIFE
    / Did not work; tx could not be defined

* Implement Jasmine
* Migrate to framework provided
    * Move files to new 'app' folder
    * Test move
    * Create 'tests' folder
    * Move spec to tests
    * add spec to require
* Create tests
    * Create test for Zombify
    * Create test for Unzombify
    * Create an initial test for each rule
    * Expand tests for each role

> Create 10 rules for English to Zombie
  * lower-case "r" at the end of words replaced with "rh".
  * an "a" or "A" by itself will be replaced with "hra".
  * the starts of sentences are capitalised (the "start of a sentence" is any occurrence of ".!?", followed by a space, followed by a letter.)
  * "e" or "E" is replaced by "rr"
  * "i" or "I" is replaced by "rrRr"
  * "o" or "O" is replaced by "rrrRr"
  * "u" or "U" is replaced by "rrrrRr"
  * "r" or "R' is replaced by "RR"
  * <create new> "y" or "Y" is replaced by "rrRhr"
  * <create new> "z" or "Z" is replaced by "hh"
* Create 3 different jasmine "expect" methods per rule.

* Extra Credit: same as above for Zombie to English
