Source:	New source only; no adaptations.
Requirements: None
Notes:
* Assignment Page: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/4290/assignments/33152
* Repo Page: https://github.com/oatmealandcoffee/zombietranslator
* Jasmine Tests need to be run with Karma on RequireJS modules.

Bugs:
* Translation getting stuck in an endless loop when regex not global
    * test for location of token
    * if location != 1, fix the token, capture the location of the fix
* Unzombify is having a hard time with certain combinations of letter because the regex will replace on the first occurrence and not necessarilly the correct one.
    * e2z   /[Rr]/g:    break       bRReak  /[Ee]/g:    bRRrrak
    * z2e   /(RR)/g:    bRRrrak     brrrak  /(rrRr)/g:  berak
    * e2z   /[Rr]/g:    three       thRRee  /[Ee]/g:    thRRrrrr
    * z2e   /(RR)/g:    thRRrrrr    thrrrrr /(rr)/g:    theer

Roadmap:
X Get input to translation functions
X Set output to input fields
* Error checking
    * automatic tests of tokens + test strings
    * string undefined
    * test string
        *   'raeiouyzr.'
        *   '  RR h a rr  rrRr  rrrRr  rrrrRr  rrRhr z  RR h .!? '
> Create 10 rules for English to Zombie
  * lower-case "r" at the end of words replaced with "rh".
  * an "a" or "A" by itself will be replaced with "hra".
  * the starts of sentences are capitalised (the "start of a sentence" is any occurrence of ".!?", followed by a space, followed by a letter.)
  * "e" or "E" is replaced by "rr"
  * "i" or "I" is replaced by "rrRr"
  * "o" or "O" is replaced by "rrrRr"
  * "u" or "U" is replaced by "rrrrRr"
  * "r" or "R' is replaced by "RR"
  * <create new> "y" or "Y" is replaced by "rrRhr"
  * <create new> "z" or "Z" is replaced by "hh"
* Create 3 different jasmine "expect" methods per rule.

* Extra Credit: same as above for Zombie to English
