Notes:
* Assignment Page: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/4290/assignments/33152
* Repo Page: https://github.com/oatmealandcoffee/zombietranslator
* Jasmine Tests need to be run with Karma on RequireJS modules.

Bugs:
* E2Z not capturing all vowels.
* Z2E only reasonably accurate with spaces surrounding Z-tokens.

Roadmap:
X Get input to translation functions
X Set output to input fields
* Error checking
    *
> Create 10 rules for English to Zombie
  * lower-case "r" at the end of words replaced with "rh".
  * an "a" or "A" by itself will be replaced with "hra".
  * the starts of sentences are capitalised (the "start of a sentence" is any occurrence of ".!?", followed by a space, followed by a letter.)
  * "e" or "E" is replaced by "rr"
  * "i" or "I" is replaced by "rrRr"
  * "o" or "O" is replaced by "rrrRr"
  * "u" or "U" is replaced by "rrrrRr"
  * "r" or "R' is replaced by "RR"
  * <create new> "y" or "Y" is replaced by "rrRhr"
  * <create new> "z" or "Z" is replaced by "hh"
* Create 3 different jasmine "expect" methods per rule.
